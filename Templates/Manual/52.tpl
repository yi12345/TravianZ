<h1><img class="point" src="img/x.gif" alt="" title="" /> event jam (00:00:0?)</h1>

<p>
All events occurring at a later time get calculated by an event system. In case the server is overloaded or the connection between webserver and database is bad an event jam can result of this.
<br />
As soon as more events are received per second than can be calculated per second, events (e.g."construction finished" or "troops arrived") will be put into a waiting loop.
<br />
The chronological order of troop movements stays the same, even in an event jam, so troops that would normally arrive somewhere first would still arrive there first.
<br />

As player, nothing can be done against an event jam except waiting. Normally these problems get resolved after a few minutes automatically. At the moment <b><?php echo $count; ?></b> events await </p>
