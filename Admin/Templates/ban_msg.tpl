Hello <?php echo $ban1['name']; ?>!
You have been banned due to a violation of the rules.
</br>
Your banning reason is <?php echo $ban1['reason']; ?>.
</br>

</br></br> To ensure that you won't get banned again in the future, you shuold read the rules carefully:
</br></br><center> <?php echo "<a class=\"rules\" href=\"rules.php\">» Game rules</a>"; ?> </center>
</br></br></br>
To continue playing contact the Multihunter and put things straight with him/her
</br></br><center> <?php echo "<a class=\"rules\" href=\"nachrichten.php?t=1&id=5\">» Write Message</a>"; ?> </center>
</br></br>
Heed the following advice when writing your message:
</br></br>
● There is always a reason for a ban. <u>Try to think about possible reasons for this ban</u> and put things straight with the Multihunter.
</br>
● Multihunters can review enormous amounts of information about accounts. <u>Stick to the truth</u> and do not make excuses to justify your violation of the rules.
</br>
● Be cooperative and insightful, this might reduce the punishment.
</br>
● If the Multihunter does not answer immediately, then he/she is probably not online. The issue will not be resolved any faster by sending multiple messages, especially if he/she did not even read the first one yet.
</br>
● If you have really been banned unjustly, try to stay <u>calm and polite</u> while talking to the Multihunter and telling him/her about your point of view.
